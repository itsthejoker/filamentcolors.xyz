    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
        One of the most annoying things in 3D printing is ordering filament,
        waiting for it to arrive, and then finding out that it's completely the
        wrong color for the project you wanted it for. Some manufacturers try to
        get around this by putting Pantone colors on their spools, but certainly
        not everyone does this. (If they did, this website probably wouldn't exist.)
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Every filament manufacturer has pictures of their product online. It's always
        super easy to compare and contrast different filament colors to make sure
        they'll work for whatever you're planning... as long as you're buying
        everything from the same manufacturer. What do you do if you want to buy
        from two different places?
    </p>

    <h4>Solution:</h4>
    <p>
        Get filaments from lots of different manufacturers, print with them, and
        photograph the results under similar conditions. The point of this website
        is not to show the "true color" of any given filament -- that requires far
        more equipment than I have the budget for. What this site does is allow you
        to compare and contrast different filament colors from different manufacturers
        using pictures taken under similar lighting conditions and similar equipment.
        It's an easy way to find that <i>perfect</i> blue you've been looking for
        that looks great with your favorite brand of gold filament.
    </p>
    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <p>
        All the images are taken in the same basic way using the same setup and same
        equipment. For every swatch, the image of the front is cropped, then the average
        color in the image (called the 'dominant color') is extracted from the image.
        This is used to create the "pure" hex color, and the hex color is what's used
        to compare to other swatches and help you figure out which filaments you like.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're interested in seeing how all this comes together into a website (and
        some of the crazy awesome math that I learned while putting this together), all
        of the source code for the site is publicly available on Github. Just click the
        link in the footer on any page of the site.
    </p>
    <h4>Dear God, why?</h4>
    <p>
        It was very frustrating to me that I couldn't tell ahead of time how different
        filaments would look when I was getting ready to purchase something specifically
        for a project. After all, like most of us, I'm not made of money and 3D printing
        is not a cheap hobby. Buying a color that defies expectations is not fun, so I
        designed this site to help out my own projects and also help others with planning
        their upcoming projects.
    </p>
    <h4>Where do the samples come from?</h4>
    <p>
        All the samples on this site are printed by me and the vast majority are from
        subscription services like Makerbox and Mondo Box. Others are from spools that
        I've purchased over the years and others are spools or color samples that were
        gifted to me. I try to not recommend or disparage any specific filament here;
        other places can do a far better job of reviewing filament than I ever could.
    </p>
    <h4>What runs this site?</h4>
    <p>
        This site is served on Digital Ocean, the backend is written in Python's Django
        framework, and the HTML / CSS is lovingly hand-written using Bootstrap as a guide.
        Cost wise, it doesn't take much -- just a few dollars every now and again. To offset
        that, I'm a member of the Amazon Affiliate program. Clicking on any of the "Buy on
        Amazon" links scattered throughout the site will provide a small kickback that I
        use solely for keeping the site running and occasionally buying sample packs to
        add new materials to the site.
