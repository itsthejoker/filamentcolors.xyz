                        The goal of this site is to allow you to quickly find colors that work well

                    Of course you don't have to pick a filament type, but most folks prefer
                    to handle one type of material over another. Most of the library is in
                    PLA, but there are lots of different filament types represented!

                    Sometimes a manufacturer may have a certain color filament in multiple
                    formats, like ABS, PETG, and / or PLA. In that case, all of the versions
                    that I have are added. There is very rarely any color variance between
                    the different plastics, but that's for you to decide.
                    <p></p>
                    Each filament type includes all of its most common sub-types; for
                    example, the PLA category includes PLA+, Pro PLA, HTPLA, and more! If you
                    want to search just a specific subtype, use the filter bar at the top of
                    the screen.

                    Most projects only need two colors, so we spin the
                    <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel" target="_blank">color wheel</a></u>
                    180 degrees and find you the closest color in the library automatically!
                    <p></p>
                    Example:
                    <p></p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-1 col-lg-2"></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-10 col-lg-8">
                            <img src="{{ welcome_experience_images.2.file.url }}"
                                 alt="An image showing the complement color section."
                                 class="welcome-experience-photo"
                            />

                        <div class="col-xs-1 col-lg-2"></div>
                    </div>
                    <p></p>
                    Due to how computers see color and the limitations of the color wheel,
                    this will work better with bright colors. As you get closer to white
                    and black, the results will be more murky.
                    <p></p>
                    As more colors are added to the library, this will become more accurate.
                    If you're interested in some of the math behind how this works, there are

    // for some reason, `await sleep` doesn't work for me.
    // Using a slightly older option to get around this. The problem here is
    // that we need the animation to finish completing to hide the modal before
    // resetting it, otherwise it will reset as it's closing and will look bad.

    // sleep time expects milliseconds
    function sleep(time) {
        return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time));
    }

    function finishbutton() {
        $("#welcomeExperience").modal('hide');
        sleep(1000).then(() => {
            resetSteps()
        });
