    <h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      One of the most annoying things in 3D printing is ordering filament,
      waiting for it to arrive, and then finding out that it's completely the
      wrong color for the project you wanted it for. Some manufacturers try to
      get around this by putting Pantone colors on their spools, but certainly
      not everyone does this. (If they did, this app probably wouldn't exist.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Every filament manufacturer has pictures of their product online. It's always
      super easy to compare and contrast different filament colors to make sure
      they'll work for whatever you're planning... as long as you're buying
      everything from the same manufacturer. What do you do if you want to buy
      from two different places?
    </p>
    <h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>
    <p>
      Get filaments from lots of different manufacturers, print with them, measure
      them, and photograph the results under similar conditions. We use
      colorimetry to show you the measured color of each plastic, then use
      that data (and color theory!) to automatically recommend other colors that
      will look good with it, regardless of manufacturer. If you know what the
      primary color of your project is going to be, let us suggest the other colors
      you should use!

      All the images are taken using the same setup and same equipment. After that, we
      use a colorimeter to measure the filament color. We take that data, plug it
      into the site, and use color theory math to suggest other colors for you to check
      out. We also show you the closest Pantone and RAL colors to the observed readings
      from the plastic, so you can see if it'll work well for something you need to
      match in the real world.

        <strong>Note!</strong> This is a hobby project, so there are certain guarantees
        that we cannot give about how accurate the Pantone / RAL matching actually is.
        You have our personal guarantee that it is as good as we can make it, but we're
        not professionals. Use your best judgement.

    <h4 id="why-do-you-call-it-a-library">Why do you call it a library?</h4>
    <p>
      The filament library, at its core, is a form of reference library. The materials
      we archive are used for reference and research purposes, and are not for sale or
      distribution. We meticulously catalog each sample, record data from them, and
      ensure that the sample is stored in a way that we can reference it in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take archiving very seriously, which is one of the reasons we don't take
      user-submitted data we cannot independently verify. We want to make sure that
      the data we have is as accurate as possible so that you are getting the best
      information we can provide.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dear-god-why">Dear God, why?</h4>
    <p>
      It was very frustrating to me that I couldn't tell ahead of time how different
      filaments would look when I was getting ready to purchase something specifically
      for a project. After all, like most of us, I'm not made of money and 3D printing
      is not a cheap hobby. Buying a color that defies expectations is not fun, so I
      designed this app to help out my own projects and also help others with planning
      their upcoming projects.
    </p>
    <h4 id="where-do-the-samples-come-from">Where do the samples come from?</h4>
    <p>
      Mostly, they come from viewers like you! Over the years, many have come from
      subscription services like the
      <a href="https://makerbox.alien3d.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maker Box</a>,
      many have come from manufacturers themselves, and many have come from spools that
      I've purchased over the years... but the most have come through independent donations
      of folks in 3D printing around the world. If you're interested in donating filament to
      the library, please take a look at the <a href="{% url 'donations' %}">donations page</a>!
    </p>
    <h4 id="can-i-send-you-data">Can I send you color data?</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, no. We need to have the plastic on hand for measurements and for
      archival afterwards; we can't take data from other sources. If you're interested
      in donating filament to the library, please take a look at the
      <a href="{% url 'donations' %}">donations page</a>!
    </p>
    <h4 id="why-is-color-hard">Why are the complement sections sometimes hilariously wrong?</h4>
    <p>
      Computers don't see color the same way humans do; there are many very long
      and very involved research papers on the subject, none of which I'm qualified
      to speak on. Color matches are as close as we can get with the color library
      we currently have and the color math used. Complements do not work super well
      on white and black filament, since the complements try to match the brightness
      of the swatch in addition to the hue.

    <h4 id="what-runs-this-app">What runs this app?</h4>
    <p>
      This app is served on Digital Ocean, the backend is written in Python's Django
      framework, and the HTML / CSS is lovingly hand-written using Bootstrap as a guide.
      Cost wise, it doesn't take much -- just a few dollars every now and again. To offset
      that, I'm a member of the Amazon Affiliate program. Clicking on any of the "Buy on
      Amazon" links scattered throughout the app will provide a small kickback that I
      use solely for keeping the app running and occasionally buying sample packs to
      add new materials to the app.

      Here's the deal: due to some folks ruining the fun for everyone, I am willing to
      take pre-printed swatches as long as you work with me first to make sure they're
      a good quality (and please don't be offended if I ask for filament cuttings per
      the normal donation process). If you want to give it a shot,
      <a href="{% url 'donations' %}">please find the process here</a>.
